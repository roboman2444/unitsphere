Simple "random points on a unit sphere" generator
Released under WTFPL

So basically I (roboman2444) needed a bunch of points on a unit sphere for some glsl stuff.
I couldn't find any generators online, so i quickly slapped a tiny one together.
I later edited it and made it more user friendly.

Usage: ./sphere SAMPLES where SAMPLES is an integer greater than 0

COMPILING
=========
gcc -O3 sphere.c -lm -o sphere

yea... just do that.
